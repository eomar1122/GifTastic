# GifTastic

GifTastic App was implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and ajax. We used the GIPHY API to request gifs and show them on the page. 


## How It Works
When a user clicks on a button, the page will grab 10 static, non-animated gif images realted to the label or value of that button from the GIPHY API and place them on the page. Then if the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate and if the user clicks the gif again, it will stop playing.
